# FFPR Compendium

FFPR Compendium is a web app that allow players of the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters to have a companion guide that contains data related to monsters, items, locations, and more for each entry in the series.

The benefits of this app include:
- Checking off bestiary entries and chests as you go
- Information on shops so that the play can quickly assess how much gold they will need to buy their items and equipment
- Game specific information for each entry in the series

## Reason behind this project
I am a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series and as I eventually play through each one, I want to quickly keep track of the monsters and chests that I've encountered and the ones I still need to find.

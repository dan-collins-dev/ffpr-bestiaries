# FFPR Bestiaries

FFPR Bestiaries is a light-weight web app that allow players of the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters to keep track of the monsters they encounter as well as see their stats, drops, their locations, etc.

## Reason behind this project
I am a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series and as I eventually play through each one, I want to quickly keep track of the monsters that I've encountered and the ones I still need to find.

## Stretch Goals

    - Chest Locations
    - Towns

    - Spells
